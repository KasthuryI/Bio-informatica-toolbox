## **Name and usage**
### **Toolbox Trimsequance**
#### This website is used for quality control and trimming fastQ files before the mapping and coverage fase of the data.
#### We created this website becouse not all of the data produced by sequancing is 100% accurate and when you want to do mapping and covarage of a reference genome you want to use the accurate data. Therefor this tool was created to help in that process. 

#### It does this by visualising the fastq data with a tool called FastQC and another tool named Trimommatic for trimming the fastQ data based on input commands.
